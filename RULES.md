# Project Rules

This document defines the fundamental rules and policies for this project.
All contributors (including Claude Code) must follow these rules.

---

## 1. Security First

- Treat security as a first-class concern at every stage of design, implementation, and review.
- Never embed secrets, credentials, or sensitive data in source code.
- Keep dependencies minimal; document the rationale for each third-party library adopted (see Rule 18).
- Integrate security scanning into the local quality gate (see Rule 20) to continuously verify the dependency chain.

## 2. Small and Focused

- Build the smallest unit that satisfies the requirement, then iterate.
- A fix must be scoped to the problem — do not refactor unrelated code in the same change.
- Prefer composition over monolithic structures.

## 3. Separation of Concerns

- Each module, package, or layer must have a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Do not mix I/O, business logic, and presentation in the same unit.
- Define clear boundaries between layers (e.g., transport, domain, persistence) and communicate across them via explicit interfaces.
- Violations of this rule make code harder to test, harder to reason about, and harder to change safely.

## 4. Testable Design

- Design code so that units can be tested independently (dependency injection, clear interfaces).
- Avoid hidden global state; make side effects explicit.
- Keep functions/methods small and single-purpose.

## 5. Implementation and Tests Together

- Write tests alongside the implementation in the same commit or PR.
- Do not merge untested production code.

## 6. Documentation Required

- Every public API, module, and non-trivial design decision must be documented.
- Documentation lives in the `docs/` directory; inline comments supplement but do not replace it.

## 7. Documentation Must Stay in Sync

- When code changes, the corresponding documentation must be updated in the same PR.
- A PR that changes behavior without updating documentation is not complete.

## 8. Test Before Marking Complete

- All tests must pass locally before a feature or fix is considered done.
- Run the full test suite, not just the tests related to the change.

## 9. Commit After Tests Pass

- Only commit (or merge) when all tests are green.
- Commit messages must be descriptive (what changed and why).

## 10. Preserve Recoverability for Large Changes

- Before making a large or risky change, create a dedicated branch so the pre-change state is always reachable.
- Use feature flags or phased rollout when behavioral changes cannot be easily reversed.
- Tag releases before breaking changes are introduced.

## 11. Language Policy for Docs and Comments

- All source code comments and primary documentation are written in **English**.
- A Japanese translation (`docs/ja/`) must be maintained in parallel and kept in sync.

## 12. Communication Language

- All communication between contributors and Claude Code is conducted in **Japanese**.

## 13. Design Before Implementation

- Before writing any production code, step back and review the overall system:
  1. Write a high-level design document (`docs/design/`).
  2. Produce a development plan with phases and milestones.
  3. Get explicit sign-off before starting implementation.

## 14. Native Code: Go + Make + Cross-Compilation

- Go is the baseline language for native/compiled code.
- Build system: GNU `make` with a `Makefile` at the project root.
- Target platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`, `windows/amd64`.
  - If Windows support is not feasible due to OS-level constraints, `linux` and `darwin` are acceptable.
- Cross-compilation must work from a single host machine (use `GOOS`/`GOARCH` variables).
- Code style: enforced via `gofmt` and `golangci-lint`.

## 15. Python: uv Virtual Environments

- Python code must run inside a `uv`-managed virtual environment.
- `pyproject.toml` is the canonical configuration file; `uv.lock` must be committed.
- Code style: enforced via `ruff` (lint + format).

## 16. Sandbox-Aware Build Configuration

- The development environment runs inside a sandbox with restricted filesystem and network access.
- Build scripts must not assume unrestricted outbound network access; vendor or cache dependencies where needed.
- Document any host-level prerequisites in `docs/setup.md`.

## 17. Git and GitHub

- All code is managed with Git; the authoritative remote is GitHub.
- This is a single-contributor project; direct commits to `main` are the normal workflow.
- Branch strategy (use when the change is large, risky, or needs isolated review):
  - `feature/<name>` — new features.
  - `fix/<name>` — bug fixes.
  - `docs/<name>` — documentation-only changes.
  - `chore/<name>` — tooling, dependency updates.
- Commit messages must be descriptive (what changed and why), regardless of whether a
  branch or direct commit is used.

## 18. Dependency Management

- Add third-party dependencies only when genuinely necessary.
- For each dependency added, document in `docs/dependencies.md`:
  - Purpose and why an in-house solution was not preferred.
  - License and any compliance considerations.
- Remove unused dependencies promptly.

## 19. Error and Warning Policy

- Errors must never be silently ignored (no bare `_ = err` in Go, no bare `except: pass` in Python).
- Compiler warnings, linter warnings, and test warnings must not be left unresolved; treat them as errors.
- Use structured logging with consistent severity levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`).
- Distinguish between recoverable errors (return/log) and unrecoverable errors (fail fast with a clear message).

## 20. Quality Gates via Local Automation (Git Hooks + Makefile)

- Quality gates are enforced locally. No hosted CI service (e.g., GitHub Actions) is used —
  cloud CI is avoided due to both cost and CGo cross-compilation complexity.
- A `make check` target runs the full quality gate: lint → vet → test → build.
- Hook split to keep the feedback loop fast:
  - **pre-commit**: runs `make vet lint` only (fast; catches obvious issues before every commit).
  - **pre-push**: runs `make check` (full gate: vet + lint + test + build) before pushing to remote.
- Hook installation is documented in `docs/setup.md` and can be automated with `make setup`.

## 21. Security Scanning

- Go: run `govulncheck ./...` as part of `make check`.
- Python: run `pip-audit` (or `uv run pip-audit`) as part of `make check`.
- Address any findings before merging; if a finding is accepted as low-risk, document the rationale.

## 22. Versioning, Changelog, and Release Packaging

- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
- Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` updated with every release (format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)).
- Release checklist (in order):
  1. All tests pass (`make check`).
  2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version and date.
  3. Commit and push to `main`.
  4. Create an annotated Git tag (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z`) and push it.
  5. Cross-compile release binaries (`make build-all VERSION=vX.Y.Z`).
  6. Package binaries: `.tar.gz` for Linux/macOS, `.zip` for Windows.
  7. Create a GitHub Release with English release notes and upload the packaged binaries as assets.
  8. Update the GitHub repository **About** section: description (English) and topics.

## 23. Code Review

- This is a single-contributor project (see Rule 17); direct commits to `main` are the normal workflow.
  External contributors must submit a Pull Request for review before merging.
- For significant changes (new features, architecture changes), perform a self-review checklist before
  committing: correctness, design, readability, test coverage, and adherence to project rules.
- If a PR workflow is used (e.g., for collaboration or isolated review), resolve all discussions before merging.

## 24. Configuration Management

- Configuration should be externalized from code, using environment variables or configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.toml`).
- Use a hierarchical approach: environment variables override file-based settings, which override code-level defaults.
- A template or example configuration file (e.g., `config.example.toml`) must be provided to document all available settings.

## 25. API Design Consistency

- If the project exposes an API (e.g., REST, GraphQL), its design must be consistent and predictable.
- For REST APIs:
  - Use resource-oriented URLs (e.g., `/users`, `/users/{id}`).
  - Use HTTP verbs correctly (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
  - Use standard HTTP status codes for success and failure.
  - Structure error responses consistently (e.g., `{"error": {"code": "invalid_input", "message": "..."}}`).
- API contracts must be documented, preferably using a standard like OpenAPI for REST.

## 26. Project Directory Structure

- Adhere to a standardized top-level directory structure to maintain clarity and navigability. A suggested structure is:
  - `api/`: API contract files (e.g., OpenAPI specs, Protobuf definitions).
  - `cmd/`: Application entry points (main packages for executables).
  - `internal/`: Private application and library code. Not importable by other projects.
  - `pkg/`: Public library code. OK to be imported by other projects.
  - `scripts/`: Helper scripts for build, install, analysis, etc.
- This structure is a guideline; adapt as needed but document the layout in `docs/structure.md`.
